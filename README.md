### Hi there 👋
🔍 Aspiring Data Scientist | Actively Seeking Opportunities

👋 I'm Marina, living in Poland, a budding Data Scientist with a background in QA. Over the past year, I've completed 15 educational projects involving data preprocessing, statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis, computer vision, machine learning, time series analysis, and NLP. My projects, ranging from customer churn prediction for a telecom operator to determining car prices and estimating ages from photographs, showcase my ability to handle diverse data types and analytical tasks.

🎯 I'm on the lookout for entry-level opportunities in Data Science where I can contribute and further develop my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and AI. Open to full-time, part-time, project-based work, or internships, with a preference for remote work in CIS countries and Poland or office work in Krakow, Poland.

🛠 Tech Stack: Python, SQL,Git, Pandas, SciPy, Keras, CatBoost, Scikit-learn, Machine Learning, Spark, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, NLP, Neural Networks, TensorFlow, PyTorch, IBM SPSS, PySpark

🌱 Previously, as a QA Engineer, I honed my team collaboration, testing planning and execution skills, alongside working closely with developers and product managers. This experience taught me the value of product quality and attention to detail.
